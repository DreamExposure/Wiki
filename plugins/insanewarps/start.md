# Installation
MAKE SURE TO ALSO DOWNLOAD NOVALIB: https://jenkins.dreamexposure.org/job/NovaLib/

Installation of NovaLib is really simple. Download the latest version from the official spigot page, then just drag and drop the .jar file into your plugins folder.
Fully stop and then start the server to generate the default configuration. Configure the plugin to your liking and completely stop and then start the server once again.

Please do not use /reload as that is meant only for developers and should NEVER be used in a production environment.

## Dependencies
* NovaLib: https://jenkins.dreamexposure.org/job/NovaLib/
* (Optional for economy support) Vault: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/
