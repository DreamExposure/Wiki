# NovaLib Modules
NovaLib is an all in one API. To handle this well, NovaLib is a module-based plugin. This means that each part of the plugin is completely independent of another and does not require other modules in order to function. Developers using NovaLib may chose to utilize one or multiple modules, so its important to understand each module, what it does, and how to set it up so that other plugins work correctly.
