# Use Cases for NovaLib
There's many reasons to use NovaLib as a server owner and as a developer. Here are just a few. 

## Minigames
NovaLib has a full minigame API built into it. As a developer you will benefit from a prebuilt system of interfaces, game handlers, and utilities. No more spending months developing a minigame, simply include NovaLib in your project and start building on top of it. NovaLib handles the hard parts of making a minigame.

## A Centralized API
As a server owner, you manage a lot of plugins. Many of those plugins have APIs and libraries that they need. This causes your server to quickly become full of various plugins with little function. NovaLib is completely different. Not only does it function as a standalone plugin, but also provides a robust and complete API for plugins. Plugins will no longer need 5 different APIs and dependencies when using NovaLib, they will only need 1.


## Easy Setup
NovaLib is designed to be easy to use. So it has an easy setup. Just drop the plugin into the server's plugins folder and restart. That's it! That's all you need to do. Should a plugin need another module from NovaLib that isn't enabled by default (Like Server CrossTalk), its very simple to enable and setup.


## NMS Code Handling
NMS code is tricky. With every MC update, it changes and requires you to build it in for every version you wish to support. With NovaLib, you don't have to worry about that anymore. NovaLib handles NMS code for many part of version specific functions. Instead of building separate versions of your plugin for each MC version, build only one and hook into NovaLib. NovaLib will handle the code that always breaks saving you from hours of headaches.


## And so Much More!
NovaLib does so much more! Too much to list, so what are you waiting for? Install NovaLib on your server today so that developers can use it to make their plugins better!
